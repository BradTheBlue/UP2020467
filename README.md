# Software Proposal Form

- Your name: Brad Haley
- Your project title: Weather Effects Interface

# Describe the theme or key idea behind your project
The project revolves around creating a Weather Effects Interface that simulates realistic ambient weather sounds using noise synthesis and modulation effects. Inspired by multi-effects audio interfaces, this software allows users to dynamically manipulate rain, wind, and thunder effects in real time to create immersive soundscapes.

# Project research
Initially, I explored designing a Multi-FX interface similar to those used in professional music production. However, I shifted my focus to crafting an interactive weather effects generator that prioritizes real-time control and user-friendly interaction. This project blends sound synthesis techniques with an intuitive visual interface to provide a meditative and immersive audio experience.

# Project development
The interface provides a simple and intuitive way for users to shape and customize weather sounds. Users will be able to adjust the intensity, wind strength, thunder level, and volume through real-time controls, ensuring a highly interactive experience.

## What do you anticipate them to hear?
Soft rain to heavy downpours (generated using white noise and band-pass filtering)

Gentle to powerful wind gusts (using pink noise modulation)

Occasional deep thunder rumbles (low-frequency oscillators with randomized bursts)
These elements will be seamlessly layered to create a fully customizable weather ambience.

## How will they interact with your software?
Sliders to adjust the intensity of each sound component

Buttons to toggle different weather effects

A real-time frequency spectrum visualizer to display sound waveforms
The goal is to make the interface accessible and engaging, even for users unfamiliar with sound design.

## What unique features does your software offer them?
Real-time sound manipulation for dynamic and evolving soundscapes

An "Extreme Mode" for intense weather effects
